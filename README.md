## 1. Summary
Date of Notes: June 21, 2025 <br />
Incident Type: Potential Impossible Travel (User Logon Anomaly) <br />
Status: Contained <br />


## 2. Initial Detection & Analysis
### Methodology:
An Azure Sentinel Scheduled Query Rule, designed to identify users logging in from more than two different geographic regions within a 7-day period, flagged a total of 38 accounts for potential "Impossible Travel." The initial detection was based on the following KQL query against the SigninLogs table:

```kql
// Locate Instances of Potential Impossible Travel
let TimePeriodThreshold = timespan(7d);
let NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed = 2;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(TimePeriodThreshold)
| summarize Count = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId, City = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).city), State = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).state), Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion)
| project UserPrincipalName, UserId, City, State, Country
| summarize PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId
| where PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances > NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed

### üìä Analysis
A total of 38 user accounts were flagged for potential impossible travel events based on logins from multiple geographic regions within a short time window. Upon investigation, most accounts showed login activity that was reasonable and within expected travel timeframes. However, one user was found to exhibit highly suspicious behavior.

‚úÖ Benign Accounts
The following accounts showed no signs of compromise. All login attempts occurred within the same country and plausible travel timelines:

All of these accounts were determined to be false positives.


## 3. Investigation
#### ‚úÖ Verification of Access Attempts
A follow-up query was used to verify whether any of the suspicious IP addresses had successful logins:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where RemoteIP in ("27.124.47.210", "103.159.255.76")
| where ActionType != "LogonFailed"
```
![analyticrulecreation7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4136541e-8f34-4b73-96c5-6739739fbed9)

#### Result:
üîí No successful logins were observed from the flagged IP addresses.

## 4. Containment Actions Taken
### Isolated Devices:
Both panbear-2nd-vm and hercules-soc were isolated in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to prevent further compromise.

###  Malware Scan:
A full anti-malware scan was initiated and completed on both VMs using MDE.

###  NSG Lockdown:
Network Security Group (NSG) rules were updated:
RDP access from the public internet was blocked.
Only the investigator‚Äôs home IP is currently allowed RDP access.
A Bastion host was proposed as a more secure alternative for future access.

### Policy Recommendation:
A recommendation has been submitted to enforce restricted RDP access for all virtual machines across the environment.
