## 1. Summary
Date of Notes: June 21, 2025 <br />
Incident Type: Potential Impossible Travel (User Logon Anomaly) <br />
Status: Contained <br />


## 2. Initial Detection & Analysis
### Methodology:
An Azure Sentinel Scheduled Query Rule, designed to identify users logging in from more than two different geographic regions within a 7-day period, flagged a total of 38 accounts for potential "Impossible Travel." The initial detection was based on the following KQL query against the SigninLogs table:

let TimePeriodThreshold = timespan(7d);
let NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed = 2;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(TimePeriodThreshold)
| summarize Count = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId, City = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).city), State = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).state), Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion)
| project UserPrincipalName, UserId, City, State, Country
| summarize PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId
| where PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances > NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed

### üìä Analysis
A total of 38 user accounts were flagged for potential impossible travel events based on logins from multiple geographic regions within a short time window. Upon investigation, most accounts showed login activity that was reasonable and within expected travel timeframes. However, one user was found to exhibit highly suspicious behavior.

‚úÖ Benign Accounts
The following accounts showed no signs of compromise. All login attempts occurred within the same country and plausible travel timelines:

### Verified each suspicious account using the query below: 

```kql
let TimePeriodThreshold = timespan(7d); // Change to how far back you want to look
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(TimePeriodThreshold)
| where UserPrincipalName == "4e122e9d51e9b00071f10e1ee3037f485ab8889007b1fd516162f9c292cc0be1@lognpacific.com"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, UserId, City = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).city), State = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).state), Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion)
| order by TimeGenerated desc 
```

#### Results: All of these accounts were determined to be Benign Positives.

## 3. Investigation
#### ‚úÖ Identified True Positive:

```kql

let TargetUserPrincipalName = "667e503b5c6895297d79a49dbe21b8b53a147fb504da9e93cb9cd03ff65d7336@lognpacific.com";

```
#### Result:
This account exhibited impossible travel behavior by logging in from San Jose, California and Shilin, Taipei within short time intervals that do not allow for realistic travel. Below are the observed logins:
