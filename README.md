## 1. Summary
Date of Notes: June 21, 2025 <br />
Incident Type: Potential Impossible Travel (User Logon Anomaly) <br />
Status: Contained <br />


## 2. Initial Detection & Analysis
### Methodology:
An Azure Sentinel Scheduled Query Rule, designed to identify users logging in from more than two different geographic regions within a 7-day period, flagged a total of 38 accounts for potential "Impossible Travel." The initial detection was based on the following KQL query against the SigninLogs table:

##### Rule logic Testing using Log Analytics Workspace

```kql
// Locate Instances of Potential Impossible Travel
let TimePeriodThreshold = timespan(7d);
let NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed = 2;
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(TimePeriodThreshold)
| summarize Count = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId, City = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).city), State = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).state), Country = tostring(parse_json(LocationDetails).countryOrRegion)
| project UserPrincipalName, UserId, City, State, Country
| summarize PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances = count() by UserPrincipalName, UserId
| where PotentialImpossibleTravelInstances > NumberOfDifferentLocationsAllowed

### üìä Analysis
A brute force detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel flagged multiple failed login attempts originating from two distinct public IP addresses. These were targeting two separate virtual machines in our environment:

| Remote IP      | Target VM      | Failed Logons |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 27.124.47.210  | panbear-2nd-vm | 26            |
| 103.159.255.76 | hercules-soc   | 40            |


## 3. Investigation
#### ‚úÖ Verification of Access Attempts
A follow-up query was used to verify whether any of the suspicious IP addresses had successful logins:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where RemoteIP in ("27.124.47.210", "103.159.255.76")
| where ActionType != "LogonFailed"
```

#### Result:
üîí No successful logins were observed from the flagged IP addresses.

## 4. Containment Actions Taken
### Isolated Devices:
Both panbear-2nd-vm and hercules-soc were isolated in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to prevent further compromise.

###  Malware Scan:
A full anti-malware scan was initiated and completed on both VMs using MDE.

###  NSG Lockdown:
Network Security Group (NSG) rules were updated:
RDP access from the public internet was blocked.
Only the investigator‚Äôs home IP is currently allowed RDP access.
A Bastion host was proposed as a more secure alternative for future access.

### Policy Recommendation:
A recommendation has been submitted to enforce restricted RDP access for all virtual machines across the environment.
